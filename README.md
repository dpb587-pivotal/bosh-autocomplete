### BOSH command autocompletion for bash

This bash script allows you to autocomplete the BOSH subcommands and
their options.

For example, if you're not sure what BOSH subcommands are available,
and this is script is installed and sourced, then simply type `bosh`
and press **Tab** twice; you will see a list of BOSH subcommands similar
to the following:

```
$ bosh
add           complete      export        logs          set           task
alias         create        finalize      micro         snapshots     tasks
aliases       delete        generate      properties    ssh           unset
autocomplete  deploy        get           public        start         update
aws           deployment    help          recreate      status        upload
backup        deployments   init          releases      stemcells     validate
blobs         diff          inspect       rename        stop          verify
cancel        disks         instances     reset         sync          version
cleanup       download      locks         restart       take          vm
cloud-config  edit          login         run           target        vms
cloudcheck    errands       logout        scp           targets
```

Furthermore, once you choose a specific subcommand, you may still enjoy the
ability to use auto-complete. For example, say you want to know what the
options for `bosh create release` are: simply type `bosh create release` and
press **Tab** twice, and you will be presented with the following options

```
$ bosh create release
--dir                --final              --name               --version
--dry-run            --force              --timestamp-version  --with-tarball
```

### Installation

To install:

```
$ . BoshAutocompleteGetOpt.sh
$ bosh c[tab]
cancel        cleanup       cloud-config  cloudcheck    complete      create
```

### Future Plans

Auto-completion script is currently auto-generated by patched BOSH CLI, and it
can reflect newly-added commands instantly.

e.g.
1. Add new command `bosh delete deployment --all`
2. run:
  ```
  $ bosh autocomplete > bosh_auto_complete.sh
  $ . ./bosh_auto_complete.sh
  ```
3. type `bosh delete deployment`, and hit tab twice, you will be able to see option `--all`

If our [pull request](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/pull/1074) is
accepted, `bosh autocomplete` will become part of the BOSH CLI.
